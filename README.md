## About
Q: **What can this tool do?**

A: It allows to adjust unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions.

Q: **How can it help me?**

A: In a situation where you accidentally sent your bitcoins to a wrong address. Using this tool you can generate a new transaction with different output address and higher fee. As a result you will be able to outpace the old transaction.

Q: **What fee should I set?**

A: It definitely must be higher than the old one and the higher, the better. By default is it set to x5.

Q: **Can I trust this service?**

A: Don't trust. Verify. This tool works on pure JavaScript and is running on your computer. You sign the transaction yourself, so this tool doesn't have access to your private keys.
